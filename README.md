# Data Science Salary Prediction Web App

* I performed extensive data cleaning and organization on a comprehensive dataset consisting of more than 65,000 entries and 11 distinct features. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency and accuracy in the data. The clean dataset served as the foundation for building an efficient data pipeline.

* To predict salaries, I developed and trained a diverse range of regression models. These models included decision trees, which are powerful for capturing complex relationships in the data, as well as TensorFlow neural networks, which excel at handling large-scale datasets. The objective was to minimize the mean squared absolute error (MSAE), a metric that measures the accuracy of the predictions.

* To make the models easily accessible and user-friendly, I integrated them into a web application using Streamlit. The application provides an interactive interface where users can input various features, such as years of experience, education level, and industry. The models then utilize this input to generate accurate salary predictions. This integration allows for a seamless user experience and facilitates quick decision-making based on the predicted salary outcomes.
